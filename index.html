	<b><h1><center><font size="10">Dana Hauprich</font></center></h1></b>
	<p><font face="verdana">A senior at Towson University in the BFA track for Photo Imaging. Strange Body is a series of photographs with the intent to blur the lines between object and body. I work primarily in fine art portraiture, often with focus on color comparisons between objects and skin.</font></p>

	<h2><a href="http://www.neave.com">Neave Interactive</a></h2>
	<p><font face="verdana">Neave is a website which allows the audience to scroll through a series of different interactive internet art webpages.</font></p>

	<p><font face="verdana">What I found particularly interesting about this website, beyond the fun, procrastinator-friendly interactive elements, was the arrows on each side of the banner. It made the site feel continuous; even though the viewer is scrolling through different websites, the essence of the neave homepage remains intact. </font></p>
